I've been lucky to travel to a few countries during my time at IIT Kharagpur and after. Here are some pictures:

Video
-------------------------
At IIT Kharagpur, I made a bunch of cover music videos with some friends. You can find our YouTube Channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCti0frgHULk80SZhvixsRmA)   

We are now physically away from each other, but you can still find some videos uploaded infrequently by some of us collaborating with the power of the world wide web.
